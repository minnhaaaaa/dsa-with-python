# DSA with Python- Based on Lectures by Abdul Bari
This repository contains my implementations of data structures and alogrithms using Python, based on Abdul Bari's lectures on Youtube.
I am using this repo to reinforce my understanding of the DSA concepts, build a solid foundation for interviews and practice clean, commented code.

Each python file includes clear implementation of the alogrithm, time and space complexity and comments for explanation and clarity

This repository is not about completing a course but rather to master the logic behind algorithms and to convert the concepts into code, I fully understand.
